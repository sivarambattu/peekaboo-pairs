Next steps would be to:
- Set up AWS Amplify and configure it for hosting
- Create the Bedrock service to generate unique card content
- Set up DynamoDB for storing high scores
- Add user authentication (optional)

Would you like me to help you with any of these next steps? Or would you like to see how to implement the game logic for shuffling cards and generating pairs?
- Also, since this is for a hackathon, we could add some unique twists like:
- Using Bedrock to generate themed content (e.g., animals, famous landmarks, etc.)
- Adding different difficulty levels
- Creating a multiplayer mode
- Adding time-based challenges

Let me know which direction you'd like to explore first!

## Chose option 3 and used the code to bootstrap application

## Asked for option to test it locally to see how it looks like

I'll help you test the current implementation. First, let's make sure you have all the necessary files and setup:

First, create a new React project if you haven't already:

```
npm create vite@latest memory-game -- --template react
cd memory-game
npm install
```

Create the file structure:

```
mkdir src/components
mkdir src/styles
```

Create the following files with the code provided earlier:

```
src/components/Card.jsx
src/components/GameBoard.jsx
src/styles/Card.css
src/styles/GameBoard.css
```

Modify your App.jsx to use the GameBoard component:


Run the development server:

`npm run dev`

Open your browser to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173)

You should now see:
- A grid of cards with question marks
- Cards that flip when clicked
- Matching pairs stay flipped
- Score increases when you find matches

To test the functionality:
- Click on any card - it should flip and reveal an emoji
- Click on another card:
- If it matches, both cards stay flipped and score increases
- If it doesn't match, both cards flip back after 1 second
- Try to match all pairs and verify the score increases correctly

If something isn't working:
- Open browser's developer tools (F12)
- Check the Console tab for any errors
- Verify all CSS files are properly imported
- Make sure all the state variables are properly initialized

Common issues to check:
- Make sure all imports are correct
- Verify the CSS files are properly linked
- Check if the emoji content is displaying correctly
- Verify the card flipping animation works

Would you like me to help you debug any specific issues you're seeing, or shall we move on to adding more features like the AWS integration?

## Using Bedrock for dynamic content generation (will pause for now)

I'll help you create a Bedrock service to generate unique card content. We'll use the Claude model via Amazon Bedrock to generate themed pairs of items for our memory game.

- First, install the AWS SDK:
```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime
```

- Create a new file for the Bedrock service:
```
// src/services/bedrockService.js
import { BedrockRuntimeClient, InvokeModelCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime";

const client = new BedrockRuntimeClient({
  region: "us-east-1", // or your preferred region
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  }
});

export const generateCardContent = async (theme, numberOfPairs) => {
  const prompt = `Generate ${numberOfPairs} unique ${theme} items for a memory card game. 
    Each item should be brief (1-3 words). Return them as a JSON array of strings. 
    For example, if the theme is "animals" and numberOfPairs is 2, return: ["Lion", "Penguin"]`;

  const payload = {
    prompt,
    max_tokens: 200,
    temperature: 0.7,
    anthropic_version: "bedrock-2023-05-31",
  };

  try {
    const command = new InvokeModelCommand({
      modelId: "anthropic.claude-v2",
      contentType: "application/json",
      accept: "application/json",
      body: JSON.stringify(payload),
    });

    const response = await client.send(command);
    const responseData = JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(response.body));
    
    // Parse the response to extract the array of items
    const items = JSON.parse(responseData.completion);
    
    // Create pairs by duplicating each item
    const pairs = items.flatMap(item => [item, item]);
    
    // Return array of card objects with unique IDs
    return pairs.map((content, index) => ({
      id: index + 1,
      content
    }));
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating card content:", error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

- Create a .env file in your project root:

```
VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
```

- Update the GameBoard component to use the Bedrock service:
```
// src/components/GameBoard.jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import Card from './Card';
import { generateCardContent } from '../services/bedrockService';
import '../styles/GameBoard.css';

const GameBoard = () => {
  const [cards, setCards] = useState([]);
  const [flippedCards, setFlippedCards] = useState([]);
  const [matchedPairs, setMatchedPairs] = useState([]);
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const initializeGame = async () => {
      try {
        setLoading(true);
        // Generate 6 pairs of cards with "animals" theme
        const generatedCards = await generateCardContent("animals", 6);
        // Shuffle the cards
        setCards(generatedCards.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5));
      } catch (err) {
        setError("Failed to generate cards. Please try again.");
        console.error(err);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };

    initializeGame();
  }, []);

  // ... rest of your existing GameBoard code ...

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading cards...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="game-container">
      <div className="score">Score: {score}</div>
      <div className="game-board">
        {cards.map(card => (
          <Card
            key={card.id}
            id={card.id}
            content={card.content}
            isFlipped={flippedCards.includes(card.id)}
            isMatched={matchedPairs.includes(card.content)}
            onClick={handleCardClick}
          />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default GameBoard;

```

To test this, you'll need:
- An AWS account
- IAM credentials with permissions to access Amazon Bedrock
- The Claude model enabled in your AWS account
```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "bedrock:InvokeModel"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:bedrock:*:*:model/anthropic.claude-v2"
        }
    ]
}
```
You can test different themes by modifying the theme parameter in initializeGame:
- "animals"
- "countries"
- "famous landmarks"
- "sports"
- "movies"
- "food items"

Would you like me to help you:
- Set up the AWS credentials?
- Test the Bedrock integration?
- Add more themes or customize the content generation?
- Handle any errors you're encountering?


## Setup AWS Amplify
I'll help you set up AWS Amplify for hosting your React application. [1]

First, install the AWS Amplify CLI globally: [2]

```
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
```

Configure the Amplify CLI with your AWS credentials:

```
amplify configure
````

Select your AWS Region  
Create a new IAM user (it will open AWS Console)  
Enter the accessKeyId and secretAccessKey for the new IAM user  
Initialize Amplify in your project:  
```
cd memory-game  # Make sure you're in your project directory
amplify init
```

```
? Enter a name for the project: memorygame
? Enter a name for the environment: dev
? Choose your default editor: (Select your preferred editor)
? Choose the type of app that you're building: javascript
? What javascript framework are you using: react
? Source Directory Path: src
? Distribution Directory Path: dist  # For Vite, use 'dist' instead of 'build'
? Build Command: npm run build
? Start Command: npm run dev
? Do you want to use an AWS profile? Yes
? Please choose the profile you want to use: default
```

Add hosting:

```
amplify add hosting
```

Choose these options:

```
? Select the plugin module to execute: Hosting with Amplify Console
? Choose a type: Manual deployment
```

Push the changes to AWS:
```
amplify push
```

Publish your app:
```
amplify publish
```

Update your .gitignore to include Amplify specific files:

```
# amplify
node_modules
dist
.env
aws-exports.js
awsconfiguration.json
amplifyconfiguration.json
amplifyconfiguration.dart
amplify-build-config.json
amplify-gradle-config.json
amplifytools.xcconfig
.secret-*
**.sample
#amplify-do-not-edit-end
```

If you want to automate deployments, you can connect your repository to Amplify Console:

- Go to AWS Amplify Console
- Click "New app" > "Host web app"
- Choose your repository provider (GitHub, BitBucket, etc.)
- Select your repository and branch
- Confirm the build settings
- Click "Save and deploy"

The build settings for Vite should look like this:
```
version: 1
frontend:
  phases:
    preBuild:
      commands:
        - npm ci
    build:
      commands:
        - npm run build
  artifacts:
    baseDirectory: dist
    files:
      - '**/*'
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/**/*
```

Your app should now be live! Amplify will provide you with a URL where you can access your deployed application.

## Setup DynamoDB for tracking high scores

- Actually lets simplify the workflow for now, so that we don't need to track players. You can modify it such that, we only keep track of the current high score and show it in the game board at the top and by the end if the current player's score beats high score we can show a message saying that its the best score now and update the highest score in the database.

I'll help you simplify the DynamoDB implementation to just track the highest score.

First, let's simplify the DynamoDB table structure. Delete the previous table if you created it and create a new simpler one:

```
aws dynamodb create-table \
    --table-name MemoryGameHighScore \
    --attribute-definitions \
        AttributeName=id,AttributeType=S \
    --key-schema \
        AttributeName=id,KeyType=HASH \
    --provisioned-throughput \
        ReadCapacityUnits=1,WriteCapacityUnits=1
```

- Install the AWS SDK for DynamoDB:

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-dynamodb @aws-sdk/lib-dynamodb
```

- Create a simplified DynamoDB service: // src/services/dynamoDBService.js

- Update the GameBoard component: // src/components/GameBoard.jsx

- Add some styling for the new score elements:

This simplified version:
- Stores only a single high score in DynamoDB
- Shows both current score and high score during gameplay
- Displays a celebratory message when a new high score is achieved
- Automatically updates the high score in the database when beaten
- Doesn't require any player identification or authentication

Would you like me to help you with:
- Testing the implementation?
- Adding a reset high score feature?
- Adding animations for score updates?
- Implementing error handling for database connectivity issues?


## Problem with high score recording

- I can see the "got a new high score" message but when I refreshed the page, I don't see the recorded high score, but I see zero for both score and high_score?

This could be happening for a few reasons. Let's debug and fix the issue:
- First, let's verify if the data is actually being saved to DynamoDB. You can check this using AWS CLI:

```
aws dynamodb get-item \
    --table-name MemoryGameHighScore \
    --key '{"id": {"S": "HIGH_SCORE"}}'
```
Problem is I didn't have the access key id and secret key within .env file, after that I got the output

```
{
    "Item": {
        "id": {
            "S": "HIGH_SCORE"
        },
        "score": {
            "N": "80"
        }
    }
}
```

## Make game more dynamic by adding timer
- Can we make the game little more dynamic by adding the timer and the score should be higher when solved in less time.

- Changes to // src/components/GameBoard.jsx, GameBoard.css


## Better score for minimal flips
- One more final tweak, can we have a mechanism to have higher score with minimal flips?

I'll modify the scoring system to include both time and flip count bonuses. Here's the updated GameBoard component with flip counting and adjusted scoring:


## Better landing page styling + name change

- Suggest a better name and styling for this within App.jsx
- <h1>Memory Match Game</h1>

- Here's an enhanced header with a more engaging name and styling for App.jsx:
- Changes to App.jsx and addition of App.css
